Personal Diary Management System

## Description

The main object of this project is user can keep their personal record like they do in a diary which is  password-protected. You can keep records of important things you do in your daily life, like meetings and  various other to do tasks. You can organize your schedule as well as view some particular entry of a  particular date or time. In this console application, you can add, view, edit and delete records. Records  can be added with information such as about your day , tasks, important meetings, time and event etc. 

## Methodology Implemented: 
First we have approached this project with the idea of a personal diary with modules of adding record,  view and modify record and 
we implemented this as a password-protected diary which implies to data  hiding concept.
Only three trails are allowed to access each module. User will give input in each module  like adding notes, to do tasks, personal information etc and without using database we used filemanagement. to store  information.
The  information is stored in a hex format  we opened through this using hex editor which decodes the text corresponding  to the binary format. 

## OOPS Concepts Used:
Data Security
Inheritance
File Handling
